# OpenGL-Mesh-Viewer

This is my solution to MIT's 6.837 OCW Assignment 0. Please watch my YouTube tutorial (https://youtu.be/XYiwt2NP1KM) for a detailed explanation on how this code was developed.

The executable **a0** requires an **.obj** file to be provided using Linux command-line redirection. For example, you can use the command **./a0 < torus.obj** to load the torus.obj file and view it. 

Once viewing a .obj file, you can press **c** to change the color of the object and press the arrow keys to move the position of the light in the scene.
